## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.5] - 2024-06-13

### Fixed

- Effectively make watching recursive when a directory is added that is known in the workflow.
- The function `amend()` now always returns `True` when the RPC client is a dummy.
  This fixes early exits from scripts that used `amend()` when they are called manually.
- Prevent the `Cannot watch non-existing directory` error by ensuring that deferred glob matches
  exist before they are included as static files in the graph.
- Check that local scripts have a shebang line before trying to execute them.
- Improved continuous integration setup
- Minor documentation improvements
- Minor code cleanups


## [1.2.4] - 2024-05-27

### Changed

- Include "hidden" files when globbing.

### Fixed

- Do not refuse to replay unchanged step that declares its own static inputs.
- Make recursive glob consistent with Python's built-in glob in `step.core.nglob`.
- Pool definitions are stored in workflow and replayed correctly when a step is skipped.


## [1.2.3] - 2024-05-19

### Changed

- Completed and revised docstrings in `stepup.core.nglob`,
  and added this module to the reference documentation.

### Fixed

- Improve hash computation of a symbolic links in `stepup.core.hash`.


## [1.2.2] - 2024-05-16

### Fixed

- Make `cleanup` command work in project subdirectories when `STEPUP_ROOT` is set.
- Avoid useless wait when running a `plan.py` script outside of `stepup`.

### Changed

- Documentation updates.


## [1.2.1] - 2024-05-07

### Fixed

- Fixed packaging mistake that confused PyCharm and Pytest.


## [1.2.0] - 2024-05-02

### Added

- Export of graphs to [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) DOT files.
- The `cleanup` script for manually cleaning up outputs.

### Fixed

- More graceful error message when the director process crashes early.
- Fix compatibility with [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) terminal recording.
- Raise `ConnectionResetError` in `SocketSyncRPCClient` instead of blocking forever when
  the director process crashes.

### Changed

- Documentation updates.
- Limit acyclic constraint to the supplier-consumer graph.
  This means a step can declare a static file and then amend it as input.
- Refactoring of the file `stepup.core.watcher` module:
    - Replace dependency `watchfiles` by `watchdog`.
    - Rename functions in `stepup.core.interact`:
        - `watch_add` -> `watch_update`
        - `watch_del` -> `watch_delete`
    - Separate watcher and runner coroutines with reduced risk for race conditions related to
      `watch_delete` and `watch_update` to address `TimeoutError`.
    - Place custom asyncio utilities in `stepup.core.asyncio`.
    - The watcher also tracks changes to static files while steps are being executed.
    - Directories are watched as soon as they are created.
- The function `stepup.core.interact.graph` takes a prefix argument instead of a full filename,
  e.g. `graph` instead of `graph.txt`.
