# Amending steps

Every step in StepUp can inform the director process of additional inputs or environment variables it uses, or of additional (volatile) outputs it creates.
Defining an amended input may not always be successful, if that file is not yet built nor known as a static file.
In this case, the step can end early and will be rescheduled by the director process when the amended input becomes available.

The [`amend()`][stepup.core.api.amend] function implements this feature and is convenient in various scenarios:

- This is particularly useful when a step uses input files that refer to other inputs files.
  It may happen that some of these other input files still need to be generated by other steps.
  Once built, the other inputs may again refer to more input files, etc.
  Such dependencies cannot be discovered in advance, simply because not all inputs are available before running the steps that generate them.
  (This is a common scenario when writing LaTeX documents of which parts are generated by scripts.)

- Another use case is that some steps may take their default configuration from environment variables if some command-line options are missing.
  In this case, `amend` can be used to specify the environment variables used.

- Some steps may produce a list of volatile outputs, some of which are difficult to know upfront.
  One may specify such volatile outputs with `amend` after they have been created.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no equivalent of `amend` in other build tools.
Some features in Ninja cover what can be achieved with `amend`.


## Example

This example intentionally creates a simple scenario with an amended input.
This is a somewhat silly example to illustrate the concept.
You may achieve the same result without amending, because you have full control over all scripts in the example.

Create the following `plan.py`, of which the first step is a script that will discover it needs an additional input.

```python
{% include 'advanced_topics/amending_steps/plan.py' %}
```

In addition, create a file `input.txt` with some arbitrary contents and the following `step.py` script:

```python
{% include 'advanced_topics/amending_steps/step.py' %}
```

Make the scripts executable and fire up StepUp to see how it deals with the amended input:

```bash
chmod +x step.py plan.py
stepup -n -w1
```

You should get the following terminal output:

```
{% include 'advanced_topics/amending_steps/stdout.txt' %}
```

The output shows that `./step.py` first stopped early due to the missing file `input.txt`.
Once this became clear, StepUp scheduled the optional step to generate the requested input.
Later, StepUp ran `./step.py` again.

## Try the following

- Rerun StepUp without making changes. As expected, all steps are skipped.
  The file `workflow.mpk.xz` also stores the amended information,
  so it does not need to be rediscovered later.
- Change the file `plan.py` to include a second amended input, e.g. `other.txt`.
  Rerun StepUp with these changes.
  Because `sources.txt` contains a new file, StepUp will try rerunning
  `./step.py`, which will amend new inputs that require the step to be rescheduled.
