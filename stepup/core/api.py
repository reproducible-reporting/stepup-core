def glob(

    """Declare static paths through pattern matching.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *patterns
        One or more patterns for static files or directories,
        relative to the current working directory.
        The patterns may contain (named) wildcards and one
        may specify the pattern for each named wildcard with
        the keyword arguments.
    _required
        When True, an error will be raised when there are no matches.
    _defer
        When True, static files are not added yet.
        Instead, the glob is installed in the workflow as a deferred glob.
        As soon as any file is needed as input and matches the pattern,
        it will be made static.
        This is not compatible with `_required=True`.
        Named wildcards are not supported in deferred globs.
    **subs
        When using named wildcards, they will match the pattern `*` by default.
        Through the subs argument each name can be associated with another glob pattern.
        Names starting with underscores are not allowed.

    Raises
    ------
    FileNotFoundError
        when no matches were found and _required is True.

    Returns
    -------
    ngm
        An `NGlobMulti` instance holding all the matched (combinations of) paths.
        This object acts as an iterator.
        When named wildcards are used, it iterates over `NGlobMatch` instances.
        When using only anonymous wildcards, it iterates over unique paths.
        It also features `ngm.matches()` and `ngm.files()` iterators,
        with which the type of iterator can be overruled.
        Finally, one may also use ngm in conditional expressions:
        It evaluates to True if and only if it contains some matches.

        `None` is returned when `_defer=True`.

    Notes
    -----
    The combinatorics allow one to construct nested loops easily in one call.
    For unrelated patterns, it may be more efficient to use separate `glob` calls.

    Environment variables in the `patterns` will be
    substituted directly and amend the current step's env_vars list, if needed.
    These substitutions will ignore changes to `os.environ` made in the calling script.
