"""Application Programming Interface (API) for interactive use of the director process.

Most of these functions are used for writing tests.
They can also be employed to create keyboard shortcuts within your IDE.

For example, one may bind the following command to an IDE's keyboard shortcut:

```bash
python -c 'from stepup.core.interact import run; run()'
```

This command must be executed in the top-level directory
where a `stepup` command is running in interactive mode.
