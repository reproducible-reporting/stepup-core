"""Application Programming Interface (API) for interactive use of the director process.

Most of these functions are used for writing tests.
They can also be employed to create keyboard shortcuts within your IDE.

For example, one may bind the following command to an IDE's keyboard shortcut:

```bash
STEPUP_DIRECTOR_SOCKET=$(python -c "import stepup.core.director; \
print(stepup.core.director.get_socket())") \
python -c 'from stepup.core.interact import run; run()'
```

This command must be executed in the top-level directory
where a `stepup` command is running in interactive mode.

You can better understand how the above example works by breaking it down into two parts:

- The command `python -c "import stepup.core.director; print(stepup.core.director.get_socket())"`
  prints the path to the socket where the director listens for instructions.
  This is a randomized temporary path that is created when `stepup` is started.
  (For technical reasons, this path cannot be deterministic
  and must be read from `.stepup/log/director`.)
  By wrapping this command in `STEPUP_DIRECTOR_SOCKET=$(...)`, the path will be
  assigned to an environment variable `STEPUP_DIRECTOR_SOCKET`,
  which will be available for the second Python call.
- The part `python -c 'from stepup.core.interact import run; run()'`
  has the same effect as pressing `r` in the terminal where StepUp is running.
  The variable `STEPUP_DIRECTOR_SOCKET` tells which instance of StepUp to interact with.
  When StepUp runs `plan.py` scripts, they also use this environment variable
  to interact with the director process.
  As these are subprocesses of the director process, the variable is set automatically,
  so you don't need to set it.
  This is only needed if processes other than subprocesses need to interact with the director,
  as in this example.
